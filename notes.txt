Find the first 50 prime numbers starting from 2

Higher Order Functions
    treat functions like data
        assign functions to variables
        pass functions are arguments to other functions
        return a function as return result from another function

Modules
    to create a module
        go mod init <module_name>

    to use a third party module
        go get github.com/fatih/color

    to update a third party module
        go get -u github.com/fatih/color

    to include a private module (not in the respository)
        in the go.mod file, add the following line
            replace dummyModule => ../dummyModule

Collections
    Array
        Fixed size
        All the data must of the same type
        Values can be accessed using an indexer
        size of the array - using the len function
        Can use the 'range' construct to iterate through an array as well
    Slice
    Map
